      <h3>Puppies To Go Story</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you think of anything that would boost morale more than a
      bouncy, velvet-eared gang of puppies? Amidst the immense stress
      of being abducted by UFOs and political corruption, think of
      how different The X-Files might have been if Mulder and Scully
      had been in the know about puppy rentals.

      Even Leslie Knope shut down the competition against reigning
      Pawnee ranger leader Ron Swanson the moment she pulled out
      her secret weapon: puppies.

      <h3>Why Rent a Puppy?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      A scholar at Emory Universityâ€™s pet therapy program explains
      that cortisol (aka stress hormones) levels are decreased and
      endorphins are increased when people interact with their pets.

      For a freshman acclimating to college life sans their beloved
      pooch, this kind of puppy playtime can offer a sweet and much
      needed taste of home particularly during peak stress points of
      the academic year, like midterms and finals.
