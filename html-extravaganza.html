            <strong>Puppies To Go Story</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Can you think of anything that would boost morale more than a
            bouncy, velvet-eared gang of puppies? Amidst the immense stress
            of being abducted by UFOs and political corruption, think of
            how different The X-Files might have been if Mulder and Scully
            had been in the know about puppy rentals.

            Even Leslie Knope shut down the competition against reigning
            Pawnee ranger leader Ron Swanson the moment she pulled out
            her secret weapon: puppies.

          <p>
            <strong>Why Rent a Puppy?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A scholar at Emory Universityâ€™s pet therapy program explains
            that cortisol (aka stress hormones) levels are decreased and
            endorphins are increased when people interact with their pets.

            For a freshman acclimating to college life sans their beloved
            pooch, this kind of puppy playtime can offer a sweet and much
            needed taste of home particularly during peak stress points of
            the academic year, like midterms and finals.
